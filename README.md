## About Yelp

The dataset I've used comes from Yelp.com made openly avalable for educational purposes. You can access the dataset by clicking [over here][1]<br>

Yelp was founded as an online reviews site, primarily for local businesses, in 2004. It had its IPO as one of the first unicorns,
meaning a firm that has greater than a $1 billion market cap, and that occurred in 2012. Its main asset is the millions of reviews for local businesses that regular users - known as Yelpers - have written and uploaded to the site.

Through 2017, over 140 million reviews were available on the Yelp website. Yelp generates most of its revenue through advertising, such as paid placements by restaurants, to the over 75 million quarterly users of the website and the Yelp mobile app. The academic data set makes a large subset of the Yelp reviews public for academic use - over four million reviews, over 150,000 businesses, in a dozen metropolitan areas.


## About Dataset

Each review contains a review text, user_id, business_id, stars between 1 to 5 (*rating in stars*).<br>
Each review also contains several important pieces of metadata, such as the review date and how many other reviewers up voted each review as funny or cool.
